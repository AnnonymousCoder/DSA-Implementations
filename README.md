# Data Structures and Algorithms
This project serves to hold implementations of data structures and algorithms I have encountered in my learning journey. It is all implemented in C.

# Structure:
The project contains each DSA in it own folder, within that folder are sub folders corresponding to a programming language that was used to implement the DSA.

```
    DSA folder
        |_ Language
```

# Languages:
The DSA's are implemented in; 
- [x] Java
- [x] C
- [ ] C++
- [ ] C#
- [ ] python
- [ ] Dart
- [ ] Rust


# Usage:
Navigate into the desired DSA and language folder in terminal then:
- For C: 
```
    make PROJECT_NAME=&lt;desired-dsa-src-file-name&gt;
```

*[ for windows replace make with mingw32-make ]*

- For Java: 
```
    java &lt;desired-dsa-src-file-name.java&gt;
```
